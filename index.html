    <!-- HOME / INTRODUCTION -->
    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Step into the Shadows... Welcome to The Eminence in Shadow! The Eminence in Shadow is a dark-fantasy action series that flips the isekai genre on its head.
      Created by Daisuke Aizawa, with manga art by Anri Sakano and an anime adaptation by Studio Nexus, the story follows Cid Kagenou—a boy obsessed with becoming the ultimate "shadow mastermind."
    </p>
    <p>
      After dying in the real world and reincarnating into a magical fantasy realm, Cid gets the perfect chance to live out his delusions. He creates a secret organization, Shadow Garden, to fight a made-up cult — which turns out to be real.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Cid thinks he's just roleplaying, he's actually waging a real war from the shadows. The manga and anime follow Cid’s double life — acting clueless by day and leading Shadow Garden by night.
    </p>
